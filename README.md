### 👋🏾 Hi there,

I'm Lehem, a software engineering student at Carleton University, diving deep into the world of code and creativity.👩🏾‍💻 

In my second year of studies, I'm captivated by the intersection of design and technology, constantly exploring how to craft seamless user experiences. From Java GUI to HTML/CSS, I thrive on blending functionality with aesthetics to create immersive interfaces.

Currently, my curiosity is leading me into the realms of artificial intelligence through utilizing Python for Deep Learning research. As I delve into this exciting field, I'm also sharpening my skills in C++ and JavaScript, seeking to engineer efficient solutions to complex problems.

Fun fact: When I'm not coding, you can find me leading as the Vice President of Carleton University's Eritrean-Ethiopian Students' Association and organizing as a Logistics Coordinator for Hack the Hill! 

Let's collaborate and innovate together! You can reach me via email: lehem.temesgen@gmail.com
